# Monster Hunter Wilds — Weapon Mechanics Research

## Core Mechanics
*   **Focus Mode**: A toggled state (Hold Focus Key) where attacks are aimed at the reticle.
    *   **Wounds**: Monsters develop "Wounds" on parts. Focus Mode highlights them (Red Glow).
    *   **Focus Strike**: A special attack available in Focus Mode. Hitting a Wound with a Focus Strike destroys it, dealing massive damage and causing a specialized stagger.
*   **Offset Attack (Clash)**: Specific attacks that, when collided with a monster's attack, negate the damage and flinch the monster. Not all weapons have a "Clash" (cinematic struggle), but most have an "Offset" mechanic.
*   **Power Clash**: A cinematic button-mashing struggle (Lance mainly).

## Weapon Specific Updates

### 1. Great Sword
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A heavy downward cleave. Can be aimed 360°. Good for waking or sniping wounds.
    *   **Adjustment**: You can re-orient the character during charge animations in Focus Mode.
*   **Clash / Offset**:
    *   **Offset Attack**: An upward swing (rising slash) that, if timed with a monster's bite/claw, parries it and knocks the monster back, allowing a free TCS follow-up.
    *   **Guard Tackle**: Retained.

### 2. Long Sword
*   **Spirit Gauge**:
    *   **Spirit Release Slash**: A new combo finisher that consumes gauge levels for big damage (replaces/augments Helm Breaker flow).
    *   **Red Gauge**: Preserved, but drains over time.
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A vertical, precise slash.
*   **Clash / Offset**:
    *   **Spirit Counter**: A timed Spirit Blade attack that acts as an Offset.
    *   **Foresight Slash**: Retained.

### 3. Sword & Shield
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A lunging precision thrust.
*   **New Mechanics**:
    *   **Slide Slash**: High mobility slash that allows repositioning while maintaining combos.
*   **Clash / Offset**:
    *   **Guard Slash Offset**: Timing an attack while guarding acts as a parry (Offset).
    *   **Shield Bash**: Can now interrupt more monster moves.

### 4. Dual Blades
*   **Demon Mode**:
    *   **Auto-Counter**: Perfect dodges in Demon Mode can trigger an automatic counter-slash.
    *   **Stamina**: Management is key; Focus Mode helps snipe weak points to regain flow.
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A multi-hit spinning lunge.
*   **Clash**:
    *   No heavy clash; relies on **Offset Dodges**.

### 5. Hammer
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A stationary, heavy overhead slam (like the Golf Swing but vertical).
*   **Clash / Offset**:
    *   **Offset Uppercut**: A timing-based uppercut that stops charging monsters.
    *   **Keep Sway**: Mobility move is now core; allows maintaining charge while dodging.

### 6. Hunting Horn
*   **Performance**:
    *   **Echo Bubbles**: Performance places a "Bubble" on the ground. Walking through it applies the buff.
    *   **Attack Up**: Adjusted to be less mandatory or balanced differently.
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A sonic blast into the wound.
*   **Clash / Offset**:
    *   **Offset Recital**: Performing a song with hyper-armor/parry properties on impact.

### 7. Lance
*   **Guard**:
    *   **Power Clash**: Blocking specific heavy attacks triggers a cinematic struggle (mash button to win).
    *   **Perfect Guard**: Negates stamina loss and allows immediate counter.
*   **Focus Mode**:
    *   **Focus Strike**: A corkscrew thrust that drills into the wound.

### 8. Gunlance

    *   **Focus Strike**: Fires a super-charged shell or stake into the wound.
*   **Clash / Offset**:
    *   **Offset Guard Shot**: Firing a shell at the exact moment of impact blasts the monster back (Parry with a boom).
